# =============================================================================
# The selector that arms grid (AC) charging: by schedule, by battery
# threshold, or both. The 3-bit field lives at register 120 bits 1-3; the
# cloud named parameter BIT_AC_CHARGE_TYPE carries the field IN PLACE
# (raw & 0x0E — the field value shifted left by one), NOT the shifted-down
# field value and NOT the 0/1/2 enum pylxpweb documents. Pinned on a live
# FlexBOSS21 (2026-07-26/27):
#   - simultaneous lockstep: local Modbus raw 0x0054 (field (raw>>1)&7 = 2)
#     while the cloud named read reports BIT_AC_CHARGE_TYPE = 4;
#   - live app lockstep: cloud read 2 while the owner's app displayed
#     "SOC/Volt"; bitParamControl write of 4 (the app's "Time+SOC/Volt") sticks,
#     re-reads 4, and preserves the neighboring reg-120 bits.
# The EG4 UI presents three options; pylxpweb's constants block pins their
# raw values 0/2/4 by Modbus probe against its own FlexBOSS21 (labeled
# Time / SOC-Volt / Time+SOC-Volt there). App labels "SOC/Volt" (2) and
# "Time+SOC/Volt" (4) are live-verified above; "Time" (0) follows from that
# probe. The LuxPower 6-mode protocol map (1=Time, 2=Volt, 4=Volt+Time on
# the shifted field) is DISPROVEN on this firmware by the lockstep — field
# 2 is Time+SOC/Volt here, not Volt.
#
# pylxpweb hazards (0.9.39b8) — why the integration bypasses its helpers
# for this register:
#   - REGISTER_TO_PARAM_KEYS[120] models BIT_AC_CHARGE_TYPE as a single bit
#     (index 1 as of 0.9.39b8; was index 3 through 0.9.39b4 — the position
#     drifts but the single-bit mis-model of the 3-bit field persists),
#     so transport read_named_parameters() returns garbage for the key (and
#     a HYBRID full-range parameter refresh publishes it — see the
#     coordinator's _overlay_ac_charge_type);
#   - cloud set_ac_charge_type()/get_ac_charge_type() speak the shifted
#     0/1/2 field while the wire wants/serves 0/2/4 — off by the shift for
#     every non-Time value.
# The parameter cache stores CLOUD-space values (0/2/4) everywhere; the

    Attributes:
        key: Stable identifier — the translation-key/unique-id prefix and
            the value of the matching pylxpweb ``ScheduleType`` member.
        cloud_prefix: Cloud named-parameter prefix (e.g. ``HOLD_AC_CHARGE``).

            ``base_register .. base_register + 5``.
        gate: Which devices get the entities —
            ``control``: every control-capable family (model substring or
            family backstop, #259);
            ``control_grid_tied``: control-capable but suppressed on
            positively-identified EG4_OFFGRID hardware (forced discharge is
            inert on the SNA platform, PR #220 / issue #197 adjudication;
            forced charge schedule writes are cloud-rejected on the family,
            issue #295 live report);
            ``offgrid``: only positively-identified EG4_OFFGRID hardware
            (the portal shows the AC First section only on the SNA
            working-mode page, issue #295);
            ``hybrid``: only positively-identified EG4_HYBRID hardware (the
            families verified on the FlexBOSS21, fails closed);
            ``hybrid_or_offgrid``: EG4_HYBRID or EG4_OFFGRID (Generator
            charge — regs 256-259 carry gen-schedule params on the SNA12K-US
            probe too).
        local_param_keys: Per-register alias chains under which the LOCAL
            parameter cache (pylxpweb ``read_named_parameters``) surfaces the
            raw packed value; the last entry is always the plain
            register-address fallback for unmapped registers.
        windows: Number of daily schedule windows (2 or 3). The schedule
            occupies ``2 * windows`` consecutive registers.
        bare_first_window: When True (classic families), window 1's cloud
            params are unsuffixed and windows 2/3 use ``_1``/``_2``. When
            False (Generator/Off-Grid/Peak Shaving), ALL windows are suffixed

            composite ``{cloud_prefix}_{START|END}_TIME{suffix}`` param instead
            of separate hour/minute writes.
        read_lsp_base: When set (Peak Shaving), cloud reads pull hour/minute
            from the interleaved ``LSP_HOLD_DIS_CHG_POWER_TIME_{n}`` params;
            index ``read_lsp_base + period*4`` gives start-hour, ``+1``
