class EG4ACCoupleSwitch(EG4CloudStoreSwitch):
    """AC Couple function switch (GH #471/#472), family-neutral.

    Toggles the inverter-level ``FUNC_AC_COUPLING_FUNCTION`` — enabling or
    disabling the AC-coupled source on the smart port outright, regardless
    of the Start/End SOC window (GH #352's number pair; portal wire name
    confirmed by two independent reporters in that issue). Distinct from the
    GridBOSS per-port ``FUNC_AC_COUPLE_EN_{n}`` functions.

    Two state sources, LOCAL-FIRST (GH #472):

    * With a local transport attached, the param resolves from holding
      register 179 bit 11, so it rides the ordinary parameter cache like
      every other reg-179 function (Export PV Only, Grid Peak Shaving).
      LOCAL-only installs gain the switch outright; HYBRID gets a local read
      that no longer waits on the 5-minute cloud getter.
    * The cloud ``ac_couple_soc`` store (throttled getter + carry-forward +
      post-write seeding) stays the source for pure CLOUD, and the fallback
      whenever the parameter cache carries no value — the SOC pair beside it
      is still cloud-only (no pinned register for those holdParams), so the
      store is fetched regardless.

    FRESHNESS TRADE-OFF, deliberate: in HYBRID the parameter cache refreshes
    on the parameter tier (``parameter_refresh_interval``, default 60 min)
    while that cloud store refreshes every 5 minutes, so preferring the
    local value can surface a PORTAL-side toggle later than #471 did. That
    is the behavior of every other reg-179 switch (Export PV Only, Grid Peak
    Shaving) and is what local-first means here; changes made from HA are
    unaffected, since the write path updates the cache in place. Users who
    want portal changes reflected faster lower the parameter interval.

    Bit 11 is NOT pinned by this project's raw↔named lockstep standard. It
    ships on lineage inference — the Luxpower Modbus doc and the
    ant0nkr/luxpower-ha-integration map both place AC coupling there, that
    reg-179 layout is the one whose bits 3/7/9/10 are hardware-proven on EG4
    hardware, and #471's reporter has driven the control through the mapping
    on his LXP — exactly the #476 green-mode precedent. Writes are
    local-first with cloud fallback, and a local write forces a parameter
    re-read of register 179 before returning, so a write that fails to land
    is visible within the cycle rather than at the next scheduled parameter
    refresh. A write that lands on the WRONG bit would still ACK, which no
    readback can catch — that is what the lockstep toggle requested in #472
    would rule out.

    The base class's full-refresh write envelope is deliberately NOT used on
    the pure-cloud path: the store IS the state source there and the
    acknowledged write seeds it directly (``note_ac_couple_soc_written``),
    so a full coordinator refresh would burn API calls without re-reading
    the throttled store.

    The cloud half of all this — the store read, availability on a known
    state, and the cloud write envelope — lives in EG4CloudStoreSwitch,
    shared with EG4SmartLoadSwitch (GH #499). Everything LOCAL-first is
    overridden here and must stay here: Smart Load's function param has no
    pinned bit at all, so a local path on the shared base would hand it a
    guessed-bit write that the firmware ACKs.

        Modes flagged ``requires_known_state`` go UNAVAILABLE while their
        state key is absent, rather than presenting a confident, toggleable
        OFF. That matters for a mode created without a family gate (GH #484
        Grid Always On): on a device whose cloud read omits the param — a
        family beyond those probed, or simply a parameter read that has not
        landed yet — a fake OFF is indistinguishable from the real thing.
        Same guarantee the AC Couple switch's override gives (GH #471), which
        is the precedent Grid Always On's family-neutral gate is modelled on.

        Charge Last and Share Battery opted in for the same reason (GH #497):
        both are ungated by family, so they carried the identical exposure.
        Their state does come from register 110 (bits 4 and 3) on LOCAL and
        HYBRID, but that narrows the absent window rather than closing it —
        a bit-field register decodes every one of its names on each
        successful read, so the keys are present whatever the bits' values,
        and what remains is the pre-first-read window.

        Still OPT-IN rather than the shared base: the remaining modes are
        family- or capability-gated, and flipping them would change
        long-standing behavior during the pre-first-parameter-read window
        for no established exposure.
