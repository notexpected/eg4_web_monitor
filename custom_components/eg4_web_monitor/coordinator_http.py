# overlaying a *stale* transport block would hide fresher cloud data. Some
# firmware exposes only a subset of batteries per page for many hours (#258: an
# 18kPV surfaces one battery by day, all of them at night), which froze the
# cloud-backed batteries. Transport blocks not read within this window are
# therefore skipped in HYBRID so the fresh cloud value stands. The window
# matches the cloud battery cache TTL: once local data is older than the cloud
# refresh interval, the cloud copy is at least as current. LOCAL-only mode keeps
# the never-evict block (it has no cloud fallback).

        Battery entity availability is literally key-presence in
        ``device_data["batteries"]``, and the HYBRID/CLOUD paths rebuild that
        dict from the cloud payload as the *baseline* every cycle.  On rotating
        >4-battery packs the cloud is fed through the same firmware page
        rotation as the local reads, so a fresh ``getBatteryInfo`` can
        momentarily omit a subset of batteries — beta.18 field logs show
        subsets of battery entities flipping unavailable seconds after a cloud
        refresh while pylxpweb's local accumulator still held every battery.

        A battery that has ever been published for this inverter is carried
        forward with its last-known mapping instead of being dropped.  The
        carried mapping keeps its original ``battery_last_seen`` /
        ``battery_last_polled`` stamps, so staleness stays visible as data —
        never as availability flapping (the #261/#282 sticky precedent).

        Two guards keep identities from doubling, and one bound keeps carried
        keys from becoming immortal:

        - ``exclude``: legacy positional keys that are aliases of a battery
          published under its canonical key this cycle (#252 migration pairs).
          Carrying one would re-mint the positional entity and permanently
          block the registry migration ("legacy key still active").
        - serial supersede: a cached key whose ``battery_serial_number`` is
          already published under a different key was re-keyed by the payload;
          carrying the old key would publish the same physical pack twice.
          The published-serial set grows as carried mappings are admitted, so
          two cached keys sharing one serial can never both be carried.
        - eviction bound: a cached key whose ``battery_last_seen`` aged past
          ``BATTERY_CARRY_FORWARD_MAX_AGE`` is a physically removed (or
          permanently vanished) pack, not a transient gap — it is evicted
          (one INFO) so removal converges without a Home Assistant restart.
