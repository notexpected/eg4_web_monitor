# device_type_code isolates XP v2, and the FUNC_ bits are register-decoded

# Backup Mode on a 12000XP v2 (serial 61062J0147, fw ceaa-000709) is
# rejected by the cloud ("failed to enable working mode"), and the EG4

#   would remove a working EPS switch from SNA-US 12K/15K owners,
#   partially reversing #259. No rejected-write report exists for it.
# - FUNC_GREEN_EN (Off Grid Mode): the write is ACCEPTED and the firmware
#   self-reverts the bit within ~10 s; the switch converges to the true

    (``transport_link_down`` — ordinary reads keep probing for recovery), so
    attachment alone cannot safely choose the write route.

    Semantics:

    - Local transport attached, link believed up: try ``local_write`` first;
      on ``HomeAssistantError`` retry via ``cloud_write`` when a cloud client
      exists (both paths set absolute state, so a double-write is safe).
      Without a cloud client the local error propagates unchanged, so
      LOCAL-only installs keep their existing error behavior.
    - Local transport attached but pylxpweb reports the link DOWN: go straight
      to the cloud instead of waiting out a doomed Modbus timeout. Reads keep
      probing the link each poll cycle, so recovery re-enables local writes.
    - No local transport: cloud path, or the standard no-transport error.

            by pylxpweb; HYBRID: cloud re-read can lag or fail), and without

    Delegates to pylxpweb's canonical ``BatteryData.is_absent()``, which treats
    zero voltage and zero SOC as insufficient on their own: an EG4 master can
    lose its cell block while still reporting live current, temperature, or
    topology, and that row is present-but-degraded rather than absent
    (pylxpweb #249/#248).  Every caller that decides whether a slot is real
    must route through here so the three sites cannot drift apart again.

    ``is_absent()`` ships in pylxpweb 0.9.39b6; against an older pin the
    fallback keeps the integration's previous voltage/SOC-only behaviour, so
    the widened definition takes effect exactly when the pin bump lands.
    ``getattr`` also tolerates the partial battery stand-ins the HYBRID
    freshness probe is deliberately defensive about.

    guard on the cloud-lost blanking check: an unbound ``Mock`` attribute is

    every row as an empty slot and silently empty the bank.
