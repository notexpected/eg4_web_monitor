          entities go unavailable instead of frozen-fresh (base_entity

        - HYBRID passes ``None`` — link-down devices keep serving

        Error-key scope (deliberate): the key is honored by MEASUREMENT
        entities — EG4BaseSensor, EG4BaseBatterySensor, and
        EG4BatteryBankEntity — because frozen measurements are the bug.
        Control-entity availability (numbers, switches, selects, update

        error-marked too in _process_local_parallel_groups, which runs
        after this method.

        (tracked in ``_link_down_notified``) and deleted on recovery.  The

        The reg-117 class of controls (no cloud parameter name — raw register
        access only, GH #272) must be created wherever local register access
        can be served. That is:

        - local-only modes (:meth:`is_local_only`);
        - a per-serial ``CONF_LOCAL_TRANSPORTS`` entry (modern HYBRID format);
        - the DEPRECATED flat single-transport format (pre-v3.2 MODBUS /
          DONGLE / HYBRID entries), whose global transport is constructed
          directly from entry data in ``__init__`` — config-based and stable
          from setup, exactly the property
          :meth:`has_configured_local_transport` pins (codex P2 on PR #284:
          that method checks only ``CONF_LOCAL_TRANSPORTS``, so flat-HYBRID
          entries silently lost the reg-117 entity). The flat format has a
          single inverter, so the global transport IS this serial's
          transport — the same equivalence :meth:`get_local_transport`
          already applies for writes.

        Flat-HYBRID caveat: the legacy global transport serves WRITES (via
        the :meth:`get_local_transport` fallback), but such entries populate
        the parameter cache from the cloud, so raw-key reads stay unknown
        until the entry is migrated to ``CONF_LOCAL_TRANSPORTS``.
