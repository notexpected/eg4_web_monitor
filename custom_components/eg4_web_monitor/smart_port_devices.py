"""GridBOSS smart-port devices: port sensors, registry sync, and migration.

Each GridBOSS smart port is its own HA device (``{serial}_smart_port_{n}``,
via the GridBOSS) holding the port's mode select and a fixed sensor set:

- **Power and current are mode-neutral** ("Power L1", "Current L2"): one
  entity reads whichever mode the port is in (the port status label IS the
  coordinator key prefix: ``smart_load`` / ``ac_couple``).
- **Energy stays per mode** ("Smart Load Energy Total", "AC Couple Energy
  Total"): each firmware counter keeps its own ``total_increasing`` entity.
  Switching one entity between counters would corrupt HA's long-term
  statistics (a jump reads as consumption, a negative delta, or a meter
  reset).

An entity whose mode is not the port's current one is disabled in the entity
registry and re-enabled when the port returns to that mode.

Earlier versions put per-mode sensors (``smart_load{n}_*`` /
``ac_couple{n}_*``) on the GridBOSS device; setup adopts those registry
entries as the port sensors, keeping their entity IDs and history.
