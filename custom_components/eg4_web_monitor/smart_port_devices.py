"""GridBOSS smart-port devices: port sensors, registry sync, and migration.

Each GridBOSS smart port is its own HA device (``{serial}_smart_port_{n}``,
via the GridBOSS) holding the port's mode select and a fixed sensor set:

- **Power and current are mode-neutral** ("Power L1", "Current L2"): one
  entity reads whichever mode the port is in (the port status label IS the
  coordinator key prefix: ``smart_load`` / ``ac_couple``).
- **Energy stays per mode** ("Smart Load Energy Total", "AC Couple Energy
  Total"): each firmware counter keeps its own ``total_increasing`` entity.
  Switching one entity between counters would corrupt HA's long-term
  statistics (a jump reads as consumption, a negative delta, or a meter
  reset).

An entity whose mode is not the port's current one is disabled in the entity
registry and re-enabled when the port returns to that mode.

Earlier versions put per-mode sensors (``smart_load{n}_*`` /
``ac_couple{n}_*``) on the GridBOSS device; setup adopts those registry
entries as the port sensors, keeping their entity IDs and history.

    power/current: ``..._smart_port{n}_{suffix}``, shared by both modes), so
    the registry entry keeps its entity ID, customizations and history.

    A power/current sensor with entries for BOTH modes is contested: only a
    VALIDATED read of an active port mode decides it (``created_at`` cannot:
    HA restores it on re-created entries, and migrated registries hold epoch
    0).  Until then it is returned as deferred, and the platform creates that
    sensor only once a later call adopts it.  For a serial in
    ``resolve_unvalidated`` (statuses that never validate, #195/#248; see
    serials_resolving_unvalidated) the unvalidated data decides instead, by
    resolve_port_mode's key-presence rule, and the adoption is marked so the
    first validated mode can reverse it (_settle_fallback_adoption): on the
    skip path both modes' keys carry the same registers, so that rule is a
    guess.  Nothing is deleted: the losing entry keeps its old unique ID
    (never created again) and is disabled and marked once, then left alone.
    Idempotent: the sensor platform reruns it against the data it creates
    entities from, and for port sensors it adds later.
