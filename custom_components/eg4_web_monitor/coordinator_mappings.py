    Two reports, two sources, same shape — a temperature channel stuck at
    exactly 0 while the radiator temperatures read live:

    - #490: the cloud ``getInverterRuntime`` payload relays a constant
      ``tinner: 0`` for some hardware (the reporter's 12000XP, and the #76
      raw payload from a second 12000XP with ``tinner: 0`` next to
      ``tradiator1: 46``/``tradiator2: 54``).  ``tinner`` is a REQUIRED
      pydantic field in pylxpweb, so the 0 is literally on the wire — there
      is no sentinel to translate.
    - #560: a HYBRID-mode 12000XP (EG4_OFFGRID, deviceTypeCode 54) whose
      LOCAL input registers serve the same constant 0 in reg 64
      (internal), reg 67 (battery) and reg 108 (BT), while radiator1/2 read
      58/61 °C and the BMS cell temps read a healthy 30/32 °C (reporter
      diagnostics confirm those live radiators).  Not a sentinel
      (127 → 0x7F already maps to None in pylxpweb), not signed-decode,
      not scaling — the DSP genuinely serves 0.

    #560 falsifies the #490 exemption for transport-backed values: the
    register path serves the same constant 0 the cloud relays, so the
    blanking now applies on every path — CLOUD, HYBRID and LOCAL — and
    covers all three affected registers.

    This is deliberately NOT a family gate.  The bad value does not track
    the inverter family: a 6000XP owner reports live ``Tinner`` of 31-32 °C
    alongside radiators at 58-65 °C in EG4's own data table, and the 6000XP
    is classified EG4_OFFGRID by ``MODEL_NAME_FAMILY_FALLBACK`` exactly like
    the 12000XP — both share deviceTypeCode 54, which nothing can split
    (#259/#307).  So the split is WITHIN the family and a family gate would
    suppress a sensor that demonstrably works on real hardware — the #307
    over-gating failure, confirmed rather than hypothetical.  Only the
    observed VALUE is treated.

    CORROBORATION (positive warmth only): blank a constant-zero target
    temperature ONLY when at least one radiator reading is STRICTLY ``> 0``
    °C.  A unit whose radiators read 58 °C is not at 0 °C ambient, so the
    0 is the bogus constant.  Radiators ``<= 0`` (cold-consistent, including
    negatives and exact 0) and absent/``None`` radiators do NOT corroborate
    — they PROTECT the reading and the 0 is published, because there is no
    evidence it is bogus.  (Earlier #490 blanked absent-radiator cloud
    ``tinner: 0`` unconditionally; that path is now warmth-narrowed.  The
    known #490/#76 reporter payloads carried live radiators, so they remain
    fixed.)

    ACCEPTED RESIDUALS (do not paper over with family/freshness heuristics —
    boot placeholder and genuine cold are physically indistinguishable, and
    the #490 lesson / ponytail ladder forbid guessing):

    - An all-zero boot/placeholder frame (targets 0, radiators 0) publishes
      the zeros until radiators warm — the original symptom on a cold start,
      accepted because the frame cannot be told apart from a genuinely cold
      unit.
    - A unit genuinely at 0 °C whose radiators nonetheless read ``> 0``
      reads "unknown" instead of 0 — small, bounded, reversible.
    - Radiators oscillating across the ``> 0`` freeze point (0↔1) can flap
      the blanking decision; the stricter threshold shrinks that window but
      the residual cosmetic noise is accepted.

#
# These tables are the SINGLE source of truth for which battery-bank sensors
# exist and which source attribute feeds each one.  Both the LOCAL path
# (BatteryBankData transport dataclass) and the CLOUD path (BatteryBank device
# object) consume them through build_battery_bank_sensors(), and the cloud
# property map is DERIVED from the passthrough tables — so adding a passthrough
# bank sensor in one place surfaces it in every mode (structural cure for the M2
# "fix-one-miss-the-other" duplication).  Behaviour that genuinely differs per
# source is preserved exactly inside the adapter and documented on each
# table/helper:
#   * CLOUD reads computed properties defensively and skips None/"" (parity
#     with _map_device_properties); LOCAL reads dataclass fields directly and
#     writes every key (incl. None) to keep the sensors present.
#   * battery_bank_power priority is reversed (see _compute_bank_power).
#   * BMS *numeric limit* registers (charge/discharge current, voltage ref,
#     cutoff, type) are LOCAL-only (_BATTERY_BANK_LOCAL_REGISTER_FIELDS); cloud
#     min-cell values are derived from per-battery data (_derive_cloud_min_cell).
#   * BMS *permission/request flags* (reg 95 bits, issue #232) ARE both-mode:
#     they need a bool->enum encoder so they live in the separate
#     _BATTERY_BANK_BMS_PERMISSION_FIELDS table (NOT the derived property map),
