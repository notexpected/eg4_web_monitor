"""Coordinator mixins for EG4 Web Monitor integration.

This module provides mixins that separate coordinator responsibilities into
logical units for better maintainability and testability.

Mypy Note: Mixins access attributes defined in the main coordinator class.
The CoordinatorProtocol documents the expected interface, but mypy cannot
verify this at the mixin level. Runtime type safety is guaranteed by the
final coordinator class inheriting all mixins together.

# log, cloud param stores, voltage limits) bounds its cloud call with its own

# (blocked egress, DNS blackhole) every one of them still burns its full
# timeout every poll cycle, serially — tens of dead seconds per cycle, forever.
# The breaker shares one connectivity verdict across all of them: after
# _SIDEFETCH_BREAKER_THRESHOLD consecutive connectivity-class failures the
# side-fetches are skipped instantly for _SIDEFETCH_BREAKER_COOLDOWN seconds,
# then attempts resume (an implicit half-open probe: one success closes the
# breaker, one connectivity failure re-opens it for another cooldown).
#
# Only connectivity-class failures count — a timeout on the outer wait_for, an
# aiohttp transport error, or pylxpweb's own connection error. An HTTP-level
# API error (auth, bad request, device offline) proves the portal IS reachable
# and resets the streak, exactly like a success.
#
# Two normal-return shapes carry connectivity evidence INSIDE the result and
# must not blindly reset the streak: a ``gather(return_exceptions=True)``
# result whose members are all connectivity-class exceptions (a failure), and
# a store getter's empty dict, which pylxpweb returns after swallowing its

        the commanded value for up to the parameter interval (default 60
        min) — visible-but-unverified for a bounded couple of minutes is

        Both stay floored by ``_last_parameter_attempt``: this deliberately
        does NOT force an immediate read, because bypassing the ~2-minute
        floor is how a device with a failing transport gets hammered every
        cycle. The HYBRID re-read is broader than the LOCAL one (it covers
