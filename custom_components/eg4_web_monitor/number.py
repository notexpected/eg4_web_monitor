        Returns None — permitting the local write — ONLY when this entity's

        never model substrings). EG4_OFFGRID, a missing family, and UNKNOWN
        all return a reason: the gate FAILS CLOSED, because an unidentified
        unit might be an off-grid inverter and the protected registers'
        local writes are exactly the evidence-ungraded class where the safe
        route must win (tribunal round 1 on #558).

        Passed to ``_write_parameter`` / ``_write_voltage_register`` the
        reason disables the local write path. Evidence state per the
        llmwiki keeper after the #570 sweep: every write proof on record
        is a CLOUD-path proof — the reg 160/161 #331 holdParam trail, and
        the 2026-08-13 cloud named toggle/restore sweep that made
        H158/H159/H160 ``hardware-toggle-proven`` on the tested
        FlexBOSS21/18kPV hybrids; H66 is firmware-proven WRITABLE (raw
        0..100) on the CEAA/CCAA images but its charge-power semantics
        are not verifiable, and no write tuple exists for it at all. What
        NO register in the set has is a local off-grid delta-test —
        LOCAL Modbus writes remain hardware-UNVERIFIED on the off-grid
        family, and a post-write readback is structurally incapable of
        catching a wrong name→register mapping there, because a
        wrong-but-writable register is firmware-ACKed and reads back
        exactly the value written (#476, #558). Matching the #471/#472
        precedent for unpinned writes, the write routes through the cloud
        until a local write is hardware-confirmed; on a pure-LOCAL
        install the returned reason is raised instead of silently writing
        an unverified register.

        HOW THE PROTECTED SET WAS DERIVED — and its blind spots.
        Criterion (unchanged since the #558 tribunal): a register is
        protected when the llmwiki ledger
        (``llmwiki/40-hardware/registers.md``) records NO local off-grid
        delta-test for it — its write evidence is cloud-path only (the
        #331 holdParam trail, the H158 cloud delta-test, the #570 cloud
        toggle sweep) or absent altogether. The #570 evidence sweep
        applied that criterion to EVERY scalar holding register this
        platform can write on a possibly-off-grid unit — both the
        entities CREATED on EG4_OFFGRID and (review round 5) the
        fail-open-created ones a not-yet-resolved family exposes — and
        every one of them fails it. The protected set is therefore ALL of
        them: the original five {66, 158, 159, 160, 161}, PV charge power
        74, battery charge/discharge current 101/102, SOC cutoffs
        105/125, stop-discharge voltage 202, system charge SOC/voltage
        limits 227/228, cutoff voltages 169/100, PV start voltage 22
        (``portal-correlated``, and pylxpweb notes reg 22 also carries
        LSP function bits), plus the fail-open-created grid-tied scalars
        reachable before family resolution: AC charge SOC limit 67
        (family-rejected on resolved off-grid, #331), forced discharge
        power/SOC 82/83, grid sell-back 103, start-discharge threshold
        116, the RAW start-charge threshold 117 (no cloud path — its
        write is refused outright on off-grid/unresolved), and the daily
        peak-shaving scalars 207/208/218/219/232 (period-1/2 SOC and
        voltage floors, PS2 power — #592, created in the same fail-open
        branch as PS1; all ``portal-correlated``, no off-grid write
        evidence). Grid peak-shaving PS1 (H206) is gated at its entity
        (review round 6): an
        earlier revision here claimed it was "cloud-only by construction",
        which the pinned pylxpweb wheel falsifies —
        ``set_grid_peak_shaving_power`` is TRANSPORT-FIRST onto raw H206;
        off-grid/unresolved families now write the cloud named parameter
        directly. Wheel-verified routing of every other cloud path this
        platform's gates rely on (r6 sweep): ``set_battery_soc_limits``,
        the battery-current setters and every ``_write_named_parameter``
        consumer (66/74/67/82/83/202) plus ``set_feed_in_grid_power_kw``
        and ``set_system_charge_soc_limit`` go straight to
        ``client.api.control`` — pure cloud, no transport branch. The #570
        firmware verification proves H158–H161 are
        correctly MAPPED on the CEAA/CCAA off-grid images, which
        discharges the wrong-address risk there but is deliberately NOT
        acted on here: a version-gated local-write upgrade is a separate,
        explicitly-out-of-scope change (#570), and cloud-only remains
        safe.
        Adjacent mechanisms carrying the same fail-closed family gate at
        their own sites (#570 rounds 1/4/5): the schedule time entities'
        packed ``write_register`` path (``time.py``), the Quick Charge
        switch's ``_prefers_cloud_control``, the coordinator's
        ``_quick_charge_prefers_cloud`` status routing, and
        ``QuickChargeDurationNumber``'s live reg-234 adjust — an earlier
        revision of this docstring wrongly claimed the off-grid H233
        rejection gated that adjust (the active check is CLOUD-routed on
        off-grid per #296, and the H233 rejection is CEAA-scoped; CCAA
        implements the address).
        Remaining blind spots (recorded, deliberately NOT converted —
        their per-bit risk is tracked in the llmwiki keeper and C7):
        bit-level function writes on the switch/select platforms (H110/
        H179/H21 bits via ``_execute_switch_action``, H179 b9/b10 regime
        selects, H20 PV input mode) and direct library calls such as
        ``set_operating_mode``. Do not treat this docstring as an
        inventory of those surfaces.

    WRITE ROUTING (#558 tribunal round 1): reg 66 is a protected register —
    no write tuple is recorded for H66 at all (its ``portal-correlated``
    semantic grade rests on read/scaling evidence; the #570 firmware
    verification proved raw 0..100 WRITABLE on the CEAA/CCAA images but
    could trace no charge-power consumer, so the semantics stay
    unverifiable), so on EG4_OFFGRID and unresolved/UNKNOWN families the
    write is CLOUD-ONLY (pure-LOCAL raises a clear error). Positively
    resolved non-off-grid families keep the local-first route. Local READS
    stay on everywhere.

    RANGE (#570 review round 4): the ceiling is family-scoped because the
    evidence is. The CEAA/CCAA firmware writer rejects raw >100 (10 kW)
    with exception 03 — firmware-proven — so off-grid AND unresolved
    families advertise/accept at most 10 kW (fail closed; pylxpweb PR
    #273 capped the canonical definition the same way). Positively
    resolved non-off-grid families keep the shipped 15 kW ceiling
    (DATA_MAPPING's raw/UI examples record 0-150 = 0-15 kW there; no
    firmware proof either way — revisit if a hybrid image is decoded).
    The read window tracks the same bound so an over-ceiling value reads

    Modelled on the AC Charge Start/End SOC precedent, NOT on PS1: the value
    is read ``params_first`` (no inverter attribute exists for these keys)
    and written through ``_write_parameter`` — a local named write on a
    positively resolved non-off-grid family, the cloud named holdParam
    (with an equality-checked readback) as the cloud path and HYBRID
    fallback. Off-grid and UNKNOWN families fail CLOSED to cloud-only via
    ``_offgrid_cloud_only_reason`` (#558): none of these registers has any
    off-grid write evidence. Unlike PS1 the entity is NOT registered
    disabled in pure-LOCAL mode — PS1's write needs a cloud client, these
    write locally by name (like reg 160).

    Scaling: the deci-unit rows (POWER_2 / VOLT / VOLT_2) hand the
    engineering value (kW / V) to BOTH paths. The transport's named write
    multiplies by 10 itself (pylxpweb ``LOCAL_PARAM_SCALE_DIV10``), so
    pre-scaling here — or routing the voltage rows through
    ``_write_voltage_register``, which sends decivolts — would land raw
    ×100 in the register (52.0 V -> raw 5200).

    Battery SOC at which AC Charge starts charging from the grid.

    On EG4_OFFGRID (the original GH #331 case) this pairs with reg 161 as
    the family's PRIMARY AC-charge SOC window, a portal-verified writable
    holdParam on the off-grid working-mode page (the reference dump reads
    90, the reporter's live config). Reg 67 (AC Charge SOC Limit) is
    family-rejected there (REMOTE_SET_ERROR + portal absence + reads 0), so
    this entity replaces it on EG4_OFFGRID.

    On EG4_HYBRID the register is equally live and MORE dangerous for being
    invisible: a FlexBOSS21 exercise recorded in CHANGELOG.md (fw
    FAAB-2727, local dongle Modbus, read+write — the ledger now grades the
    H160 WRITE PATH ``hardware-toggle-proven`` on the tested hybrids from
    the #570 cloud sweep, while this exercise's charge-start SEMANTICS
    remain a CHANGELOG-recorded observation) showed reg 160 initiating AC
    charging
    whenever battery SOC is below it, regardless of the reg-120
    ACChargeType selector and of the AC-charge time windows — charges start
    out-of-window at SOC < value, and no window charge starts at
    SOC > value. The portal exposes the field for the family as "Start AC
    Charge SOC(%)"; without this entity its factory default of 90 silently
    defeats any window/ToU charge schedule. There it pairs with reg 67
    (pylxpweb's set_ac_charge_soc_limits writes 160 as start and 67 as
    end), so the related-refresh set spans all three SOC-window entities.

    Whole percent, SCALE_NONE on both paths; reg 160 is in pylxpweb's
    transport name map, so local named reads/writes work as-is. Writes cap
    at 90% (pylxpweb's register definition and hybrid setter bound). That
    cap is firmware-proven ONLY on the CEAA/CCAA off-grid images (writer
    rejects >=91); on hybrid families it is portal-correlated, the same
    evidence tier as the reg-105 cap #603 falsified — revisit if a hybrid
    ever stores a portal-typed value above 90.

    RANGE FLOOR (#570 review round 4): family-scoped because the evidence
    is. The CEAA/CCAA firmware writer rejects 0 with exception 03 —
    firmware-proven — so off-grid AND unresolved families advertise/accept
    a minimum of 1 (fail closed; pylxpweb PR #273 set the canonical
    minimum to 1 the same way). Positively resolved non-off-grid families
    keep the shipped 0 floor (0's semantics there are unverified, but
    nothing proves it invalid — revisit if a hybrid image is decoded).
    The read window tracks the same floor so a below-floor register value
    reads unknown instead of tripping HA's out-of-range state error; the
    ceiling read window stays the tolerant 100.

    WRITE ROUTING (#558): on EG4_OFFGRID the write is CLOUD-ONLY — every
    H160 write proof is CLOUD-path (the #331 holdParam trail, and the
    #570 sweep's cloud named toggle/restore, ``hardware-toggle-proven``
    on the tested FlexBOSS21/18kPV hybrids), no LOCAL off-grid delta-test
    exists, and no readback can prove a wrong name→register mapping
    didn't land elsewhere (#476), so the local path is not attempted; a
    pure-LOCAL off-grid install gets a clear error instead. The #570
    firmware verification proved the mapping on the CEAA/CCAA off-grid
    images (and that raw 0 is invalid — min is 1); a version-gated local
    upgrade is a recorded candidate on #570 only. On EG4_HYBRID the write
    keeps the normal local-first route per shipped behavior. Local READS
    stay on for both families — reads are harmless and reg 160 reads are
    verified.

    Battery SOC at which the off-grid family's AC Charge working mode stops
    charging from the grid — with reg 160 the family's PRIMARY AC-charge
    SOC window, a portal-verified writable holdParam on the off-grid
    working-mode page (the reference dump reads 100, the reporter's live
    config). Reg 67 (AC Charge SOC Limit) is family-rejected there
    (REMOTE_SET_ERROR + portal absence + reads 0), so this entity replaces
    it on EG4_OFFGRID.

    Deliberately NOT created on grid-tied families (unlike the Start
    entity): pylxpweb models the grid-tied stop threshold as reg 67
    (set_ac_charge_soc_limits pairs 160 with 67), and the #332 note records
    reg 161 as READ-ONLY on grid-tied hardware — reads fine, no verified
    write. If a grid-tied write is ever verified, revisit.

    Whole percent, SCALE_NONE on both paths; reg 161 is in pylxpweb's
    transport name map from 0.9.36b28, so this entity mirrors the Start
    entity exactly (named reads on every path).

    WRITE ROUTING (#558, superseding the PR #332 review note): LOCAL
    Modbus writes to reg 161 are hardware-UNVERIFIED on the off-grid
    family — all #331 write evidence is the cloud holdParam path, the
    #570 firmware verification proved only the MAPPING on the CEAA/CCAA
    images (no live off-grid write exists), and the #570 sweep confirmed
    the register write-INERT on a second grid-tied hybrid (cloud success,
    raw unchanged) — and a post-write readback CANNOT discharge the
    off-grid risk: a wrong-but-writable register is firmware-ACKed and
    reads back exactly the value written (#476), so the readback reports
    success on precisely the failure it was cited against. The write is therefore CLOUD-ONLY on this entity
    (created for EG4_OFFGRID only), matching the #471/#472 precedent for
    unpinned writes; a pure-LOCAL install gets a clear error instead of an
    unverified local write. Local READS stay on — reads are harmless and
    verified. Revisit if a local reg 161 write is ever hardware-confirmed
    on off-grid hardware (named vendor action, raw register read before
    and after, restoration).

    """Spec-driven Smart Load panel number (GH #499, cloud client required).

    The portal's Maintenance -> Remote Set -> Smart Load Port -> "Smart Load"
    tab governs when the inverter's smart load port is energized: the SOC pair
    (start/end percent), the PV-power threshold, and a voltage pair that
    appears to stand in for the SOC pair under a voltage mode (the reporter's
    screenshot greys it out while SOC mode is active — UNTESTED here, and no
    mode parameter was found to gate on, so both pairs are exposed).
    @brendonlobo123 asked for all of them on a 12000XP (#499); Grid Always On
    from the same panel shipped first (#484).

    CLOUD-ONLY, dedicated store — the same arrangement as the AC Couple SOC
    pair (#352) for the same reasons: the portal writes
    ``_12K_HOLD_SMART_LOAD_{START,END}_{SOC,VOLT}`` and
    ``_12K_HOLD_START_PV_POWER`` and no local Modbus register is pinned for
    any of them, and a cache-seeded value would be wiped by the next parameter
    refresh under a local transport (PR #380 review P1). Values come from the
    coordinator's ``smart_load`` store (throttled 5-minute cloud getter reads +
    carry-forward + post-write seeding) in every mode, and writes always route
    through the cloud client.

    Unavailable while the value is absent from the store — never a confident 0
    on an inverter that does not carry the param. That the cloud really does
    answer with FUNC_SMART_LOAD_ENABLE present and all five holdParams missing
    is established, not assumed: it is what a GridBOSS returns (live probe
    2026-08-01). A GridBOSS itself never gets these entities — setup creates
    them only for inverters — so the case this guards is an INVERTER whose
    portal read comes back in that same partial shape.

    Disabled by default: niche, and the WRITE path is unverified on hardware
    (#484's read-verified/write-unverified position, awaiting the reporter).
