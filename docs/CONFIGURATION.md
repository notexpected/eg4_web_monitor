# Configuration

Full configuration reference for EG4 Web Monitor.

## Connection Types

The integration supports five ways to reach your equipment. The connection
*type* is derived automatically from what you configure — you do not choose it
upfront.

| Connection type | Description | Update speed | Internet required |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cloud API (HTTP)** | Connect via EG4's cloud service | 30 seconds | Yes |
| **Local Modbus TCP** | Direct RS485 connection via adapter | 5 seconds | No |
| **WiFi dongle** | Direct connection via the inverter's WiFi dongle | 5 seconds | No |
| **Serial Modbus (USB/RS485)** | Direct USB-to-RS485 serial connection | 5 seconds | No |
| **Hybrid** | Local polling + cloud for DST sync & quick charge | 5 seconds | Yes (cloud features) |

- **Cloud credentials only →** HTTP mode (30s polling).
- **Local device(s) only →** Local mode (5s polling).
- **Both cloud and local →** Hybrid mode (5s polling plus cloud-only features
  such as DST sync and quick charge).

### Cloud API (HTTP)

The easiest setup. Uses your EG4 Monitor account credentials to communicate with
EG4's cloud servers. No additional hardware is needed and it works anywhere with
internet, at the cost of a 30-second update interval and a dependency on EG4's
servers.

### Local Modbus TCP with a Waveshare RS485 adapter

For faster updates and local-only operation, connect directly to your inverter
using an RS485-to-Ethernet adapter such as the Waveshare RS485 to ETH (B).

#### Hardware

The following is the tested and validated setup. Other RS485 adapters and cables
may work, but this is what we recommend:

- **RS485 to Ethernet adapter** — choose one:
  - **Waveshare 2-CH RS485 to ETH** — 2 channels (~$25)
  - **Waveshare 4-CH RS485 to POE ETH** — 4 channels, PoE (~$45) — best for
    multiple inverters
- **RS485 cable** — 2-wire twisted pair:
  - a spare CAT5/CAT6 pair, or
  - shielded RS485 cable (recommended for long runs)
- **Ferrule crimping tool** — for clean, reliable RS485 terminal connections
- **Ethernet cable** — adapter to network
- **Network switch** — any managed switch works

> The 4-channel PoE version lets you connect multiple inverters or other RS485
> devices (such as energy meters) to a single adapter and powers it over
> Ethernet — no separate power supply needed. For cable runs over 50 feet, use
> shielded cable to reduce interference.

```

> On EG4 18kPV inverters, the RS485 port is labeled "BMS/Meter" and is on the
> bottom of the inverter. Use pins 1 (A), 2 (B), and 3 (GND).

#### Waveshare adapter settings

1. Connect the adapter to your network via Ethernet.
2. Open the web configuration at `http://192.168.1.200` (default IP).
3. Configure:
   - **Network:** static IP (e.g. `192.168.1.100`), subnet `255.255.255.0`,
     gateway = your router IP.
   - **Serial port:** baud `19200`, data bits `8`, stop bits `1`, parity `None`.
   - **Working mode:** `TCP Server`, local port `502` (standard Modbus TCP).
4. Save and restart the adapter.

#### Home Assistant side

During setup, select **Local Modbus TCP (RS485 adapter)**, then enter the
adapter's IP (e.g. `192.168.1.100`), port `502`, unit ID `1` (default for most
inverters), your inverter's serial number, and inverter family.

### Serial Modbus (USB/RS485)

Connect directly to your inverter using a USB-to-RS485 adapter (FTDI, CH340, or
CP2102-based) plugged into the host running Home Assistant — no network adapter
needed. Wire the RS485 cable to the inverter's Modbus port using the same wiring
as the Waveshare setup above.

During setup, select **Local Device → Serial (USB/RS485)**, choose your serial
port from the dropdown (RS485 adapters are prioritized) or enter a path
manually, and the integration auto-discovers the model and serial number.

> **Docker/HAOS:** you may need to pass the USB device through to your container.
> For Docker, add `--device /dev/ttyUSB0:/dev/ttyUSB0` to your run command. For
> HAOS, USB devices are typically auto-detected.

### WiFi dongle

If your inverter has a WiFi dongle on your local network, connect directly to it
on port 8000. You need the dongle's serial number (on its sticker).

> Some newer dongle firmware versions block port 8000 for security. If the
> connection fails, use the Modbus or Cloud API method instead.

### Hybrid

Combines local polling (Modbus, dongle, or serial) for fast sensor updates with
the Cloud API for cloud-only features. Best for users who want fast local
updates and also need DST auto-sync and quick charge control. Battery data is
available via all local connection types — cloud is not required for battery
monitoring.

## Adding the Integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services** → **Add Integration**.
2. Search for **EG4 Web Monitor** and select it.
3. Choose a starting point:
   - **Cloud (HTTP):** enter your EG4 Monitor credentials (username, password,
     base URL), select your station, and optionally add a local device to create
     a hybrid connection.
   - **Local Device:** choose Modbus TCP, WiFi Dongle, or Serial; enter the
     connection details. The model and serial number are auto-detected.

## Reconfiguration

To change settings, open **Settings → Devices & Services**, find **EG4 Web
Monitor**, click the **⋮** menu → **Reconfigure**, and choose:

- **Update Cloud Credentials** — change username, password, base URL, or station.
- **Add Local Device** — add a Modbus, dongle, or serial connection (upgrades
  HTTP → Hybrid).
- **Remove Local Device** — remove a local transport.
- **Detach Cloud** — switch from Hybrid to Local-only mode.

Existing automations and dashboards are preserved.

> **Changing stations:** if you switch to a different station/plant, entity IDs
> change to reflect the new station's devices. Automations and dashboard cards
> referencing the old IDs need updating, and history from the old station stays
> but is no longer connected to the new entities. Changing only credentials for
> the same station leaves entity IDs unchanged.

## Configuration Options (Refresh Intervals)

After setup, click **Configure** on the integration to customize:

- **Sensor Update Interval** — how often to poll sensor data (5–300 seconds).
  Default: 5 seconds for local connections, 30 seconds for HTTP.
- **Parameter Refresh Interval** — how often to sync configuration settings
  (5–1440 minutes). Default: 60 minutes.
- **Data Validation** — toggle canary checks and energy-monotonicity guards on
  incoming readings. Default: on. Shown for all connection types.
- **Modbus Read Block Size** — shown when a local (Modbus/dongle/serial)
  transport is configured. **Conservative** (default) keeps the small grouped
  register reads every dongle and firmware supports; **Fast** reads up to 120
  registers per request (~4 fewer round-trips per poll) for tooling that polls
  at 15 s. Older dongle firmware that only supports ~40-register reads
  automatically latches back to conservative reads without interrupting polling
  (#254).

> Lower sensor intervals give faster updates but increase network/API load. For
> local connections, 5 seconds is recommended; for the cloud API, 30 seconds
> balances responsiveness with server load.

If you change settings directly on the EG4 website (not through Home Assistant),
parameter data such as working-mode switches may take up to the parameter
refresh interval to update. Press the refresh-data button to force an immediate
parameter sync.

## Entities and Controls

### Switches

- **Quick Charge** — start/stop battery quick charging. Works in all modes
  (local, hybrid, and cloud) since #251.
- **Battery Backup (EPS)** — enable/disable emergency power supply mode.
- **Daylight Saving Time** — enable/disable DST for station time sync.
- **Charge Last** — flip PV surplus to charge the battery last (register 110
  bit 4, all modes; #177).
- **Share Battery** — per-inverter shared-bank toggle for multi-inverter systems
  (register 110 bit 3; disabled by default as a niche feature; #306).
- **Working modes** — AC Charge, PV Charge Priority, Forced Discharge, Peak
  Shaving, Battery Backup Control.
- **Grid sell-back controls** (grid-tied families only — EG4_HYBRID / LXP) —
  **Grid Sell Back** and **Export PV Only** (#135), and **Fast Zero Export**
  (#274). Off-grid XP units have no export to suppress, so these are not created
  there.
  > **EG4 Off-Grid family (12000XP/6000XP):** the **Forced Discharge**,
  > **Peak Shaving**, **Grid Sell Back**, **Export PV Only**, and **Fast Zero
  > Export** switches are not created — these grid-parallel functions are inert
  > on the no-sellback SNA platform (PR #220 / #197 adjudication). If you had
  > them from an earlier version, a Repairs issue explains the removal.

### Selects

- **Operating Mode** — Normal or Standby.
- **GridBOSS Smart Port Mode (1–4)** — Off, Smart Load, or AC Couple per port.
- **Battery Charge Control** / **Battery Discharge Control** — regulate the battery
  by **SOC** (closed-loop, default) or **Voltage** (open-loop). See
  [Battery control mode](#battery-control-mode-soc-vs-voltage) below.
- **AC Charge Based On** — what arms grid (AC) charging: **Time** (the AC Charge
  schedule windows), **SOC/Volt** (the battery SOC/voltage thresholds), or
  **Time+SOC/Volt** (both) — the vendor app's three options (register 120,
  EG4_HYBRID family only). The controls on the side the firmware ignores go
  *unavailable*: in SOC/Volt mode the AC Charge schedule time entities, in
  Time mode the AC Charge SOC Limit and the AC Charge Start/End Voltage pair.
  This mirrors the vendor app, which hides the ignored side outright — the
  trade-off is that a gated control cannot be pre-staged until the mode is
  flipped. A value the app cannot display (possible via direct register
  writes) shows as an unknown selection and gates nothing.

### Numbers

- System Charge SOC Limit (%)
- AC Charge SOC Limit (%) — grid-tied families only; on the EG4 Off-Grid family
  it is replaced by **AC Charge Start Battery SOC** and **AC Charge End Battery
  SOC** (%) (registers 160/161, enabled by default; #332)
- AC Charge Start Battery SOC (%) — also created on EG4 hybrid inverters
  (FlexBOSS/18kPV family), where register 160 starts grid charging whenever
  battery SOC is below it, alongside AC Charge SOC Limit as the stop
  threshold (writes cap at 90%; #331/#488)
- On-Grid SOC Cut-Off (%), Off-Grid SOC Cut-Off (%)
- System Charge Voltage Limit (V), AC Charge Start / End Voltage (V),
  On-Grid / Off-Grid Cut-Off Voltage (V) — voltage-mode limits (see below)
- Stop Discharge Voltage (V) — the voltage-regime counterpart of the Forced
  Discharge SOC Limit (register 202; all modes)
- AC Charge Power (0.1 kW increments)
- PV Charge Power
- PV Start Voltage threshold
- Grid Sell Back Power (kW cap) — grid-tied families only (register 103; #135)
- Grid Peak Shaving Power (not on the EG4 Off-Grid family — see the working
  modes note above)
- Forced Discharge Power (kW) and Forced Discharge SOC Limit (%) (not on the
  EG4 Off-Grid family)
- Start Discharge Power Threshold (W) — CT-equipped grid-tied inverters, all
  modes; and **Start Charge Power Threshold** (W) — LOCAL/HYBRID only, disabled
  by default (the cloud has no parameter name for it) (#272)
- Quick Charge Duration (minutes) — mirrors register 234 live in LOCAL/HYBRID;
  a cloud-only install keeps it as a start-minute preference (#251)
- Battery Charge Current
- Battery Discharge Current

### Battery control mode (SOC vs Voltage)

Two selects — **Battery Charge Control** and **Battery Discharge Control** — set how
the inverter regulates the battery: by **State of Charge** (closed-loop, the default
and existing behavior) or by **Voltage** (open-loop, for lead-acid or no-BMS packs).
They mirror the inverter's own setting (register 179, bit 9 = charge, bit 10 =
discharge; `0` = SOC, `1` = Voltage), so **changing a select writes to the inverter**
— and the inverter propagates the change to every unit in a parallel group.

To reduce clutter, the limit entities for the **active** mode are enabled by default
and the other mode's limits are created but disabled. (Changing a select only sets
this initial default; Home Assistant keeps any manual enable/disable you make, so
enable any disabled limit yourself if you want it.)

Some EG4 web UI labels differ from the Home Assistant entity names — match them here
(or by the **EG4 param key**, shown on the EG4 cloud *Parameter Read* page):

| EG4 web UI label | Home Assistant entity | Reg | EG4 param key | Enabled by default when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | **Battery Charge Control** (select) | 179·b9 | `FUNC_BAT_CHARGE_CONTROL` | always |
| — | **Battery Discharge Control** (select) | 179·b10 | `FUNC_BAT_DISCHARGE_CONTROL` | always |
| **System Charge Volt Limit(V)** | System Charge Voltage Limit | 228 | `HOLD_SYSTEM_CHARGE_VOLT_LIMIT` | Charge = Voltage |
| **Back Up Volt(V)** | AC Charge End Voltage | 159 | `HOLD_AC_CHARGE_END_BATTERY_VOLTAGE` | Charge = Voltage |
| — | AC Charge Start Voltage | 158 | `HOLD_AC_CHARGE_START_BATTERY_VOLTAGE` | Charge = Voltage |
| — | System Charge SOC Limit | 227 | `HOLD_SYSTEM_CHARGE_SOC_LIMIT` | Charge = SOC |
| — | AC Charge SOC Limit | 67 | `HOLD_AC_CHARGE_SOC_LIMIT` | Charge = SOC |
| — | On-Grid Cut-Off Voltage | 169 | `HOLD_ON_GRID_EOD_VOLTAGE` | Discharge = Voltage |
| — | Off-Grid Cut-Off Voltage | 100 | `HOLD_LEAD_ACID_DISCHARGE_CUT_OFF_VOLT` | Discharge = Voltage |
| — | On-Grid SOC Cut-Off | 105 | `HOLD_DISCHG_CUT_OFF_SOC_EOD` | Discharge = SOC |
| — | Off-Grid SOC Cut-Off | 125 | `HOLD_SOC_LOW_LIMIT_EPS_DISCHG` | Discharge = SOC |

**Periodic balancing (Voltage mode):** set **Battery Charge Control** to *Voltage*,
then raise **System Charge Voltage Limit** (the absorption/balance target) and
**AC Charge End Voltage** — EG4's *"Back Up Volt(V)"*, the battery voltage at which
grid/AC charging stops. Both are writable and automatable from Home Assistant.

### Time entities (schedule windows)

Native Home Assistant **time** entities expose the portal's working-mode schedule
windows, so automations can reshape charging/discharging windows instead of
editing them in the EG4 web portal. Seven schedule families are supported, each
with up to three windows × (start, end):

| Schedule | Windows | Availability |
|---|---|---|
| **AC Charge** | 3 | all control-capable families (#277) |
| **AC First** | 3 | EG4 Off-Grid (SNA) family only |
| **Forced Charge** | 3 | grid-tied families |
| **Forced Discharge** | 3 | grid-tied families |
| **Peak Shaving** | 2 | EG4_HYBRID family |
| **Generator Charge** | 2 | EG4_HYBRID and EG4 Off-Grid families |
| **Off-Grid** | 3 | EG4_HYBRID family |

Values follow parameter polling, so changes made in the EG4 portal appear in
Home Assistant; LOCAL/HYBRID write the packed register directly while cloud uses
the portal's named parameters. Whether a schedule is *honored* is still governed
by the matching enable switch (e.g. the AC Charge switch, register 21 bit 7).

> **All schedule time entities are created disabled by default** (#312). They
> serve a limited automation use case and add entity noise for most installs.
> Enable the specific windows you automate from **Settings → Devices & Services
> → Entities**. Entities you have already enabled keep their state.

### Notable sensors

Beyond the standard power/voltage/current/energy sensors, 3.4.0 adds:

- **Operating State** — the operating-mode code decoded into a friendly enum
  (e.g. `Battery → Grid`, `Off-Grid (Battery)`), all modes (#262).
- **Off-Grid** (binary sensor) — whether the inverter is running disconnected
  from the grid, all modes (#262).
- **Fault Code** / **Warning Code** (diagnostic) — per inverter in LOCAL and
  HYBRID modes (the cloud API doesn't carry these fields).
- **Quick Charge Remaining** — the live quick-charge countdown in **seconds**
  (#251).
- **Smart Load Power** / **Grid Load Power** — the off-grid family's GEN-terminal
  split, surfaced in Cloud and Hybrid modes (#222).

The **Cloud Status** sensor (formerly "Status") reports the cloud
connection/health string; its entity ID is unchanged.

### Buttons

- **Refresh Data** — force a refresh for devices and batteries.

### Service actions

The integration registers three service actions (callable from **Developer
Tools → Actions** or automations). See each service's fields in the UI (defined
in `services.yaml`).

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `eg4_web_monitor.refresh_data` | Force an immediate refresh of all device data, bypassing the polling interval. Optional `entry_id` targets a single config entry (default: all). |
| `eg4_web_monitor.reconcile_history` | Backfill missing energy statistics from the EG4 cloud for gaps in your energy-sensor history (requires cloud/hybrid mode). Accepts `lookback_hours` or an explicit `start_date`/`end_date`, and an optional `entry_id`. |
| `eg4_web_monitor.import_historical_data` | Import plant-level daily energy history (PV yield, consumption, grid import/export, battery charge/discharge) from the EG4 cloud into Home Assistant long-term statistics as external statistics, selectable in the Energy dashboard. Idempotent, bounded to 2 years per call, with a `dry_run` preview. Requires cloud/hybrid mode (#73). See the README for a full walkthrough. |
