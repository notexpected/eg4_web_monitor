  # since 80e8221 touches only transport, CI and release files (#326,
  # #329 / PR #330), so no register definition, semantic, or evidence
  # grade changed.
  # Re-pinned at the 2026-09-02 beta.15 release cut: PR #608 merged as
  # 5092b5b and pylxpweb PR #327 merged as 80e8221 (released in 0.10.0b8).
  # Re-pinned at the 2026-09-02 beta.14 release cut: PR #605 merged as 041032f.
  # The pin is commit-only per _conventions.md (machine tooling passes it to

  # (v3.5.1-beta.12 mainline, contains the PR #569 routing). Rows
  # describing the #570 sweep-extended routing (H227/H234 shipped-path notes,

  # PR #600 / issue #570 citations (the durable artifact — the PR diff
  # survives branch deletion; embedded SHAs staled twice in review).
  # Re-pinned at the 2026-08-30 release cut: PR #600 merged as d8e2027, so
  # the sweep-extended rows now verify at the mainline pin below (inline
  # PR #600 / issue #570 citations remain as provenance). pylxpweb was
  # ab87902 (0.9.39b11) until the 2026-09-02 #603 ingest moved it to

  # the H66/H160 rows below and shipped family-scoped in the integration).
  # The c78ab7e..80e8221 holding-definition delta adds entity keys for
  # H207/H208/H218/H219/H232 and 40.0-64.0 V bounds to H208/H219; register
  # semantics and their portal-correlated grades are unchanged. The H208/H219
  # rows in src/pylxpweb/registers/inverter_holding.py state that these bounds
  # are a maintainer-chosen guard with no firmware/portal bound captured, so
  # `verified-against-code` attests only that the rows carry the bounds, not
  # that the window is hardware-correct (see the two pinned blob sources).

# Register ground truth

> **Audited result: 41 of 348 counted current register claims are proven: 33 `firmware-proven` + 8 `hardware-toggle-proven` = 41; 33 + 8 + 171 `portal-correlated` + 135 `lineage-inferred` + 1 `inferred` = 348.** The arithmetic and row contributions are reproducible from the audit command below; this accounting assertion is `asserted-unverified`, not a code-behavior claim. Register semantics retain their own row grades.

This page is canonical for register semantics and evidence status. **When it conflicts with [`docs/DATA_MAPPING.md`](../../docs/DATA_MAPPING.md), this page wins.** `DATA_MAPPING.md` remains a useful implementation/derivation source, but its names and derivations are subordinate to the family scope, evidence grade, and status recorded here.

The grade vocabulary is owned by the [llmwiki evidence-grade legend](../README.md#evidence-grade-legend); this page does not redefine it. The register-annotation ladder in that legend applies here. In particular, `hardware-toggle-proven` requires a named action on the target family, a captured pair of raw integer register words before and after, and successful restoration. Scaled engineering values are not raw captures and must not be back-computed into one. Component firmware is scope metadata: when it was not recorded, the claim is limited to the tested unit. `refuted` is recorded only in the **Status** column; the **Evidence** column grades the evidence that disproves the historic claim.

## Auditable accounting

| Evidence | Count | Proven? |
|---|---:|:---:|
| `firmware-proven` | 33 | yes |
| `hardware-toggle-proven` | 8 | yes |
| `app-write-path-proven` | 0 | no |
| `portal-correlated` | 171 | no |
| `lineage-inferred` | 135 | no |
| `inferred` | 1 | no |
| `verified-against-code` | 0 | no |
| `asserted-unverified` | 0 | no; candidate rows are excluded |
| **Current total** | **348** | **41 proven (11.8%)** |

The `Claim count` column is the machine-checkable contribution. One separately named semantic is one claim; a U32 low/high pair is one; family-specific meanings are separate; a compound packed-word contract is one claim unless its bits are separately exposed as independent semantics. Structural-only, candidate, unknown, and `asserted-unverified` rows contribute zero. Refuted historic labels are outside the counted ledger. The markers around the ledger allow an `awk -F'|'` sum of column 7 to reproduce every subtotal.

From the repository root, this prints the exact grade subtotals and total used above:

```sh
awk -F'|' '/counted-ledger:start/{on=1;next}/counted-ledger:end/{on=0} on && /^\|/ && $7 ~ /^[[:space:]]*[0-9]+[[:space:]]*$/ {g=$5;c=$7;gsub(/[`[:space:]]/,"",g);gsub(/[[:space:]]/,"",c);n[g]+=c;t+=c} END{for(g in n)print g,n[g];print "TOTAL",t}' llmwiki/40-hardware/registers.md | sort
```

Pinned code anchors for this notation are the `registers/__init__.py` exports [`INVERTER_INPUT_REGISTERS`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/registers/__init__.py#L104-L123), [`INVERTER_HOLDING_REGISTERS`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/registers/__init__.py#L77-L100), and [`GRIDBOSS_REGISTERS`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/registers/__init__.py#L46-L72); [`dongle.py::MODBUS_READ_HOLDING` / `MODBUS_READ_INPUT`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/transports/dongle.py#L73-L77) pins FC03/FC04. [`constants/registers.py::MIDBOX_REGISTER_TO_PARAM_KEYS`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/constants/registers.py#L1072-L1098) pins the GridBOSS holding map, and [`DEVICE_TYPE_CODE_GRIDBOSS`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/constants/registers.py#L1825) is 50.

Unless a row says signed, the current canonical decoder treats it as unsigned. U32 values use the lower-address word as low word: `(high << 16) | low`. This decoding convention is `verified-against-code` at [`_canonical_reader.py::read_raw`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/transports/_canonical_reader.py#L34-L82).

Two sub-claims stay `asserted-unverified`: the pylxpweb definition's note that "reg 22 also carries LSP function bits" (no per-family capture — a strong extra reason local scalar writes stay gated), and the shipped spec comment that firmware rejects values below 140 V with error code 3 (`number.py` `pv_start_voltage` spec; no preserved exchange). No write tuple (raw before/after/restore) and no off-grid write evidence exist; the #570 audit routes off-grid/unresolved writes through the named-volts cloud route only.

Routing since the [#570 audit](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/eg4_web_monitor/issues/570) (this change set): the write passes `local_write_blocked_reason` from `_offgrid_cloud_only_reason`, so EG4_OFFGRID and unresolved/UNKNOWN families route CLOUD-ONLY and pure-LOCAL raises; a positively resolved non-off-grid family keeps the local-first route (HYBRID may fall back to cloud; LOCAL has no fallback). Code anchors: `number.py::SystemChargeSOCLimitNumber.async_set_native_value`, `number.py::_offgrid_cloud_only_reason`, `utils.py::async_write_with_cloud_fallback`. Residual risk (`inferred`): the local-first route on resolved non-off-grid families still exceeds the tested-unit evidence scope — do not assume a local write is established on FlexBOSS21, 12kPV, or another untested target. History: escalated on [issue #558](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/eg4_web_monitor/issues/558#issuecomment-5232409553); pre-#570 the write was local-first with no family gate at all. |

Note the off-grid live-active check is cloud-routed (#296), so no local H233 read ever gated this write. |

#### H233 off-grid access boundary

| Claim | Scope | Evidence | Status | Durable basis and qualification |

Proves the #296 live rejection reports on that lineage. A negative claim proven by disassembly; scoped to the decoded CEAA build. |
| CCAA (6000XP lineage) **implements** the H233 address (reader `0x08030A2E`; writer stores the low 16 bits), but only bits 1–2 are packed toward the DSP and **no bit-0 quick-charge consumer was found** — no proven local quick-charge route exists on CCAA either. | decoded CCAA image | `firmware-proven` | current; b0 semantics unresolved | Same #570 firmware verdicts. The earlier family-wide "off-grid rejects H233" claim was too broad — it is now lineage-scoped to CEAA. |
| Live LOCAL FC03/FC06 access to H233 returned ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS. | tested `EG4_OFFGRID` units (#296/#308 reports) | `asserted-unverified` | current | [`DATA_MAPPING.md`](../../docs/DATA_MAPPING.md#extended-function-enable-2-register-233) and [bug postmortems #296/#308](../60-history/bug-postmortems.md) record the rejection; no preserved raw request/exception-response capture exists, so the live reports stay at this grade (the firmware proof above stands on the disassembly, not on them). |
| Shipped routing: the Quick Charge switch **fails closed in every configuration** — only a positively resolved non-off-grid family keeps the local H233 route. Cloud-less off-grid/unresolved units get an unavailable switch and a forced service call raises before pylxpweb is reached (PR #569, 2026-08-13); with a cloud client, off-grid AND unresolved families go cloud-direct (#570 audit review round 4 — an unresolved unit might be a CCAA 6000XP, where the local H233 write is silently ACCEPTED with unproven bit-0 semantics, so a cloud fallback is no safety net). | current integration | `verified-against-code` | current | [PR #569](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/eg4_web_monitor/pull/569) (merged; `switch.py` → `_offgrid_without_cloud` availability gate) for the cloud-less half; the cloud-present unresolved half is part of the [#570 audit](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/eg4_web_monitor/issues/570) change set (`switch.py` → `_prefers_cloud_control`, now `not is_positively_non_offgrid_family(...) and has_http_api()`). This superseded the earlier shipped-path exposure this section recorded — pure-LOCAL off-grid toggles no longer attempt the rejected write, and unresolved-family cloud entries no longer attempt the CCAA-silent one. |

## Schedule write evidence boundary

These claims elaborate the counted schedule rows; they do not add to the ratio.

| Claim | Family scope | Evidence | Status | Durable basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Each schedule block is consecutive start/end pairs: base/+1 window 1, +2/+3 window 2, and +4/+5 window 3 where configured. | Per-family `SCHEDULE_TIME_TYPES` gates | `portal-correlated` | current | [`DATA_MAPPING.md` schedule table](../../docs/DATA_MAPPING.md#schedule-time-window-registers-277--295--312) and live named-register probes. |
| Packed time is `hour \| (minute << 8)`; hour low byte, minute high byte. | Schedule families represented by the captured probes | `portal-correlated` | current | FlexBOSS21/SNA probes plus `time.py::_decode_from_cache`; example 01:05 → H211 raw 1281. |
| Current LOCAL/HYBRID schedule writes issue one packed-register call documented as Modbus FC06 through `EG4ScheduleTimeEntity._async_set_value_locked()` and `EG4DataUpdateCoordinator.write_register()` — since the #570 audit review round 5 (part of the PR #600 change set) only on a positively resolved non-off-grid family; off-grid/unresolved families route through that schedule's own cloud write path — writeTime families (Generator/Off-Grid/Peak Shaving, including an off-grid inverter's Generator Charge schedule) use the atomic `write_time_parameter` portal call, classic families (AC Charge/First, Forced Charge/Discharge) use the per-field hour/minute writes (routing corrected in review round 10; an earlier revision said "classic cloud field writes" for all of them) — and a pure-LOCAL install raises. | Current integration path | `verified-against-code` | current | [`time.py`](../../custom_components/eg4_web_monitor/time.py) and [`coordinator.py`](../../custom_components/eg4_web_monitor/coordinator.py); no transport wire capture is claimed. The schedule rows above are `portal-correlated` from CLOUD probes — no local off-grid schedule write evidence exists, which is what the fail-closed routing encodes (#563's clear-schedule button recorded the same posture first). |

No raw wire evidence establishes a firmware-level FC16 rejection. The current integration’s single-register FC06 path is `verified-against-code`; the rejection comment remains `asserted-unverified` and is not a hardware claim.

## Keeper notes

### I67 `0x7F` sentinel

| Fact | Evidence | Status | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| I67 is the battery-temperature word. | `portal-correlated` | current | Local I67 and cloud `tBat` feed the same field in current mappings. |
| Raw `0x007f`/127 represents no battery-temperature reading on a no-BMS secondary. | `portal-correlated` | current | Normalize only this field to unknown; do not publish 127 °C or confuse it with register I127. |
| No qualifying induced before/after raw capture is present in the cited durable record. | `asserted-unverified` | unresolved | This is an evidence-inventory absence claim, not code behavior; a code citation cannot prove that no capture exists. |
| pylxpweb normalizes the exact battery-temperature value 127 to `None` on every construction path. | `verified-against-code` | current | [`data.py` at `204b95d`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/transports/data.py#L62-L70) defines the sentinel; [`__post_init__`](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/blob/204b95d/src/pylxpweb/transports/data.py#L312-L321) performs the normalization. This code fact does not upgrade the hardware observation. |

### Four-slot individual-battery ceiling

| Explicit fifth/sixth-slot probe reads returned EMPTY; the attempted fifth-slot implementation was reverted. | `asserted-unverified` | current | `memory/issue-258-battery-rr-reg96-unreliable.md`; do not restate `DATA_MAPPING.md`’s “max 5” as established hardware fact. |
| Systems with >4 packs may surface more identities through reported firmware rotation. | `asserted-unverified` | unresolved | No endpoint, field, widget, or preserved portal agreement is cited. Rotation is firmware-dependent and its trigger remains unknown; accumulate observed identities by serial, but do not treat slot count as physical pack count. |

| H110 b8 is Green/Off-Grid Mode. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | H110 b8 is **UNKNOWN**. The wrong b8 write was ACKed and did not control Green Mode; no PVCT/CT function is claimed. H110 b14 is `hardware-toggle-proven` on the tested 18kPV unit. | [Contradiction C5](../60-history/open-contradictions.md); `memory/issue-476-green-mode-bit14.md`. |
| H110 b5 is Take Load Together. | `hardware-toggle-proven` | refuted | The named Take Load Together control toggled b10 while b5 stayed set throughout; b10 was restored byte-perfectly. | [pylxpweb #242 live-capture record](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pylxpweb/issues/242#issuecomment-5152609179). |
| H110 b6 is Buzzer. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | Current candidate is b7; b6 is unknown. | Safe register map and portal correlation. |
| H110 b9 is Battery ECO. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | Current candidate is b15; b9 is unknown. | Safe register map and raw correlation. |
| 12000XP/off-grid I123 is generator power. | `firmware-proven` | refuted | It is an ARM-initialization counter modulo 65,536 with nominal ~1 Hz increment. | `OFFGRID_GENERATOR_REGISTERS.md`. |
| Off-grid I124-I126 are generator energy. | `firmware-proven` | refuted | I124 is status/metadata; I125-I126 are one U32 status word. | `OFFGRID_GENERATOR_REGISTERS.md`. |
| Hybrid I131/I132 are L1/L2 apparent power. | `firmware-proven` | refuted | I131 is a sign-split DSP quantity; I132 is an event counter. Exact I131 physical label remains unresolved. | `HYBRID_EPS_REGISTERS.md`. |
| I21/I22 are usable EPS S/T voltage on observed US split-phase hardware. | `firmware-proven` | refuted | Decoded values are not those voltages; exact replacement semantics remain unresolved. | Both EPS firmware analyses. |
| I129/I130 represent only the EPS-load subset. | `firmware-proven` | refuted | They are combined backup-path L1/L2 active power on off-grid firmware. | `OFFGRID_EPS_REGISTERS.md` plus `DATA_MAPPING.md` backup-output comparison. |
| I171/I172-I173 are whole-home consumption. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | They are inverter-served `Eload_day` / `Eload_all`. | `DATA_MAPPING.md` consumption-vs-load-energy section. |
| I32/I48-I49 `Erec` is load energy. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | It is AC/grid charge energy. | `DATA_MAPPING.md` `Erec` correction. |
| GridBOSS I105-I108 carry smart-port status. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | GB-H20 carries mode; GB-I104-I119 are energy words. | [GridBOSS owner note](gridboss.md#smart-port-mode-register-owner). |
| H21 contains grid peak-shaving enable. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | Current correlated enable is H179 b7. | `DATA_MAPPING.md` H179 section. |
| H231 is peak-shaving power or a high word. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | H206/H232 are period-1/period-2 power; H231 meaning is unknown. | `memory/live-write-window-findings.md` and canonical holding map. |
| H103 is a percentage. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | Raw units are 100 W and portal/UI displays kW. | `DATA_MAPPING.md` H103 raw/UI examples. |
| H66 is a percentage. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | Raw units are 100 W and portal/UI displays kW. | `DATA_MAPPING.md` power-control section. |
| I67 raw 127 is 127 °C or means register I127. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | It is the no-temperature sentinel value inside I67. | I67 keeper note above. |
| B+14/B+15 use the old swapped cell-index map. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | B+14 is temperature cell numbers; B+15 is voltage cell numbers. | `DATA_MAPPING.md` live local/cloud capture. |
| H64 is the PV-charge power entity target. | `portal-correlated` | refuted | H64 remains a legacy percent command; current PV-charge power target is H74. | `DATA_MAPPING.md` H64/H74 correction. |

## Peak-shaving current map

| Function | Register | Evidence | Status | Qualification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Enable | H179 b7 | `portal-correlated` | current | Complete raw before/after and restoration record is absent. |
| Period-1 power / SOC / voltage | H206 / H207 / H208 | `portal-correlated` | current | H206 is 0.1 kW. |
| Period-2 SOC / voltage / power | H218 / H219 / H232 | `portal-correlated` | current | H231 is not a high word. |
| Two schedule windows | H209-H212 | `portal-correlated` | current | Packed time; family-gated to `EG4_HYBRID`. |

## Source hierarchy

The canonical vocabulary and ladder live in the [llmwiki README](../README.md#evidence-grade-legend). For this ledger, implementation tables and `DATA_MAPPING.md` cannot by themselves establish a hardware semantic. Passing tests establish software consistency only; they never promote a register mapping to `hardware-toggle-proven`.

Detailed derivations remain in [`DATA_MAPPING.md`](../../docs/DATA_MAPPING.md), [`OFFGRID_GENERATOR_REGISTERS.md`](../../docs/reference/firmware/OFFGRID_GENERATOR_REGISTERS.md), [`OFFGRID_EPS_REGISTERS.md`](../../docs/reference/firmware/OFFGRID_EPS_REGISTERS.md), and [`HYBRID_EPS_REGISTERS.md`](../../docs/reference/firmware/HYBRID_EPS_REGISTERS.md), subject to this page’s precedence and grades.
